# Project_Sentiment_analysis
This is my final year project of my graduation in B Tech IT from University Institute of Technology, Himachal Pradesh University, Shimla, Himachal Pradesh. 
This is a ML app on stock sentiment analysis using the news headlines. 
This app has been deployed using two strategies: 
a) Flask and Flasgger
b) Streamlit
This repository contains all the files required for smooth functioning of this app.
