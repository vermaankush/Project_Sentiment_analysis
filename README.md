# Project_Sentiment_analysis
This is the final year project of my graduation in B Tech IT from University Institute of Technology, Himachal Pradesh University, Shimla, Himachal Pradesh. 
This is an ML app on stock sentiment analysis using the news headlines. 
This app has been deployed using following strategies: 
a) Flask and Flasgger,
b) Streamlit.
This repository contains all the files required for smooth functioning of this app.
The model.pkl file was around 29 MB and it exeeced the file size limit in github, so I have uploaded its .rar file which can be decompressed.
